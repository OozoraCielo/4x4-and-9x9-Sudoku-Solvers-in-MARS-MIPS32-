# 4x4-and-9x9-Sudoku-Solvers-in-MARS-MIPS32-
A University of the Philippines Project that mainly focuses on the use of MIPS32

For this project, we were tasked to make a sudoku solver using MIPS32.
There are 2 sizes of boards: 4x4 and 9x9. I created the code by first making a C code and translating it to MIPS32.

The input for the 4x4 solver is expected in this format:
```
1000
0001
0400
0020
```
The expected result is:
```
1342
4231
2413
3124
```

The input for the 9x9 solver is expected in this format:
```
005800009
210000050
070900600
000201035
000000000
780405000
004006020
030000061
600003500
```
The expected result is:
```
465812379
219367458
378954612
946271835
523698147
781435296
154786923
832549761
697123584
```

Please see the documentation file for more information on how I solved this.
